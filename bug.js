The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This is a common issue when using asynchronous operations with Firebase, where the data may not be available immediately when you try to access it.  For example:
```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then(doc => {
  console.log(doc.data().myField); // Error: myField may be undefined
});
```
This error may not always show up consistently, making it difficult to debug. The error message might not be immediately clear, indicating just a general type error or undefined.
