# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous data fetching.  The problem arises when attempting to access properties of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded, potentially resulting in undefined values and unclear error messages.

The `bug.js` file contains code that exemplifies this issue. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to properly handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase data retrieval and avoid the error.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and configure the necessary credentials.
3.  Run `bug.js` to observe the inconsistent error behavior.
4.  Run `bugSolution.js` to see how to properly access the data after it's fully loaded.

## Solution

The solution involves using `.then()` to handle the promise returned by `get()` and ensuring that the data is available before accessing its properties.  Error handling is also crucial to provide a more robust solution.
